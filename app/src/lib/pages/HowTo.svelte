                    This tool is designed to work better with database pages than raw pages, but you can use
                    both. Some features may not be available to raw pages. (they are marked as <b>db-only</b>)

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <h3>First, create a notion doc üê£</h3>
            <p>
                Click on Login and grant access to the notion page you've just
                created.
                If you have created your notion page <b>after</b> login, don't worry, just logout and login again to add
                your new page.
                Because notion keeps in memory which pages you have already granted access, you won't have to give
                access again to already granted content.
            </p>
            <h3>Now you want to create a slide ü§î</h3>

            <p>
                In this notion-slider, we use dividers elements in notion to split the document into slides.
            </p>


            <h3>Slides control üîÆ</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Use <b>Right arrow</b> on your keyboard to go to next slide.</li>
                <li> Use <b>Left arrow</b> on your keyboard to go to previous slide.</li>
                <li> Use <b>Bottom arrow</b> To expand Toggles on the page</li>
                <li> Use <b>Top arrow</b> To reduce Toggles on the page</li>
            </ul>


            <h3><abbr title="Too many information">TMA</abbr>, i'm lost üò±</h3>
            <p>
                Don't worry, you can use <a class="link"
